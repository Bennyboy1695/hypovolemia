##Fastcraft
This pack contains Fastcraft, by Player, enabled by default. Fastcraft enhances Minecraft with increased performance. Bug reports being made directly to Mod Authors should state Fastcraft is enabled.

##Compiling
to start with you need to download the .zip file or pull the repos

we then need to extract the files the easiest way to do this is to right click and use Extract To
![Extraction example](https://snag.gy/JdaFjN.jpg)

now you should have a file named the same as the .zip from earlier now we need to build the version we do this by using the commands below you can use shift right click to open a comand prompt in the folder
![Opening CMD](https://snag.gy/FOuzv6.jpg)

we then simply type whats below

Terminal/Command Prompt:

    ./gradlew buildAll

Windows syntax:

    gradlew buildAll

it should look something like this 
![CMD Example](https://snag.gy/FDWcKI.jpg)

it will say "building client" and "building server" this is perfectly normal this will build a version for you this can take a little while but not horribly long
when done you should see this
