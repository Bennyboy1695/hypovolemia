	In this world botany has progressed beyond science and into the realm of magic. These flowers you grow with botania will change your world around you in a different sense.
	
	There are multiple different types of flowers associated with botania, first of which would be /Generating Flowers/. These flowers create an essence called Mana.
	
	Mana can be extracted from these flowers by using Logs and flower petals created using botania to make an object called a /Mana Spreader/.
	
	This mana spreader will suck in Mana essence from surrounding plant life and form it into a singular burst of a physical manifestation of mana.
	
	In order to catch that mana, you must create a storage unit for them called a /Mana Pool/, which will provide a means to store, use, and disperse mana.
	
	There are lots of things and items you can build with mana, All you need to do is take a look in your book.",
