	Spells in Bloodmagic can be quite complex and have many different effects.
	
	There are basic spells and complex spells.
	
	Basic spells can be made by putting a Spell Foci in a blood altar. Then you place a spell table next to it.
	On the spell table, you place a mob head. Finally you need to click the spell table with an unbound crystal.
	
	This binds the crystal to the spelltable and altar. You cant alter the setup without loosing the spell power.
	
	An exmaple : Zombie head and glowstone will create a spell that creates random lightning around you. Now, isnt that usefull?
