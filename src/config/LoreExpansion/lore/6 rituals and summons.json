	Lets plants grow faster, summon stuff change day to night just to name a few.
	
	Rituals need blocks setup in specific patterns. Best is to look at them at the FTB Wiki (http://ftbwiki.org/Ritual).
	
	For rituals theres also a ritual diviner avaible. You can choose your ritual and click the master stone with it and it will build the ritual for you (assuming you have everything needed in your inventory).
	
	Summoning on the other hand is again a new tiered multiblock that you need to build on your own. Once again, the wiki will help you to build it and also explains how to summon different creatures. (http://ftbwiki.org/Summoning)",
