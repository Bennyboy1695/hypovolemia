    "body":"The blood in the altar is something you can see, nearly feel. But theres also your personal blood network which you cannnot see.
	
	Its invisible but used for everything YOU do with bloodmagic. When you use rituals, sigils, spells or items from bloodmagic they most likely have a cost too.
	
	Some of them can even kill you since it will draw on your health when your blood network cannot pay for its use.
	
	The key to transferring blood to the network are the orbs. When you place them into an altar they will start to move the blood from the altar to your network.
	
	Some things, like the alchemy set, will need an orb that is bound to you as well. You can also right click with the orb in your hand. You allready know how it pricks.
	
	To actually see how much LP (Life points, aka blood, aka life essence) you have in your network you need a divination sigil. Theres a quest for it in the second questline.",
