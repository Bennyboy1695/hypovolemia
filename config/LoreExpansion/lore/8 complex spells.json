	We now need to create paradigms, effects, modifiers and enhancements.
	
	This time we will try something more usefull. 
	
	The spell will pull blocks from under you when you use it on the ground. This can be pretty usefull for a quick ascend.
	
	To form the spell, we drop down a Self Augmentator. Then connect it to an earth former and this one to a default modifier.
	
	Then we bind a complex spell crystal to it.
	
	Oh did we forget about the enhancements? 
	
	When you use the spell now you pull a single block. When you add a reinforced spell empowerer to your spell structure, it will drag a 3*3 of blocks.
