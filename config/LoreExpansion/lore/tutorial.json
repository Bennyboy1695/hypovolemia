    "body":"There are alot of changes to the usual way the mods in this pack work. 
	
	Be sure to use NEI and read the quests to guide you.
	
	This mod here is called Lore Expansion and we will use it to give you some hints or explanations that dont fit into the questflow.
	
	(Basics to some mod mechanics)
	
	Lore pages will be given out by the questbook when you reach the fitting milestone.
	
	We hope you will enjoy this modpack - Caithleen & Slind
